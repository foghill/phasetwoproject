# Rick and Morty Wikipedia

At its core, this web app is a minimal interface for searching across the TV show Rick and Morty's compendium including character data, locations and episode facts.

## Rick and Morty API

All data comes from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

A working demo of this app has been hosted on Netlify and can be [accessed here](https://rickandmortyflatiron.netlify.app/)

The API is called in the App.js file using the useEffect hook and an [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-immediately-invoked-function-expression-iife/)

The API returns three important resources in the object: Characters, Locations, Episodes.

The API 'paginate's the response, and returns 20 records per page. [Pagination npm package](https://academind.com/tutorials/reactjs-pagination) was used to help build the navigation and interface.

## The npm packages used are:

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

[Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)

Sass helps create custom stylesheets for components, here is how to [add sass to react](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/add-sass-to-your-react-app-in-2021-here-is-how-c7260c323a5a)

[React-Router-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

[React Paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)

Paginate is an awesome package which helps create a page navigation bar

## App Breakdown

The web app is split up across a few different components including but not limited to:

### Homepage

The Homepage is the entry point for the app, and acts as a Character page. A Filter component is displayed along the left column which allows a filter functionality to isolate across [Status,Species,Gender]

A Navbar displays the other components: Episode and Location.

A Searchbar component is also displayed, allowing the user to search for characters across the entire compendium.

### Characters Cards

Clicking on a character will bring up another component: their specific character attributes

This includes a dynamic button which renders green if the character is currently alive in the series, or red if the character is dead. The other attributes pulled from the API are Gender, Origin, Location and Species.

### Episode

On this component, an accordion on the left hand side allows one to choose any episode across all 51. Depending on the episode chosen, the characters that appear in that particular episode will populate the page. Character cards can also be accessed through this interface.

### Location

Similarly to the episode page, an accordion on the left hand page appears, this time allowing the user to select among all 126 known locations in the series. Once a location is chosen, all the characters currently residing in this particular location will populate, and can also be accessed directly through their Character Card.
